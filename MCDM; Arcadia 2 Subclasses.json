                "Ceaseless winter winds howl as they tear across the pale landscape, eventually calming to a slight breeze as snow falls in the quiet and cold night. Blinding storms give way to moments of eerie calm and stillness. For some, the sea- son is a time to huddle inside until such cold days pass, but wizards of the Order of Hibernation embrace both the chance for rest and the might of the winter storms.",
